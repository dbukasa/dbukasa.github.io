Dear Readers,

While being in class, I often struggled to pinpoint where digital humanities truly fit within the broader landscape of academia and cultural workings. It felt like something similar to a specialized niche that is to the edges of both the humanities and the digital world. It reminded me of encountering abstract art for the first time, intriguing yet perplexing, meaningful yet far away in meaning. The difficulty was in connecting the seemingly abstract ideas we discussed in class to the concrete, tangible results one might seek in a more traditional humanities course. For a time, I saw digital humanities as a series of tools and approaches whose outcomes were more conceptual than practical, as if we were constantly on the verge of something significant, but never quite landing on stable ground. Yet as the semester progressed, the field started to reveal itself, especially as we moved outside the classroom and into workshops, site visits, and hands-on experimentation.

It was during our visit to Penn‚Äôs Special Collections and the Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text & Image (SCETI) that I first felt the intellectual currents of digital humanities in motion. Wandering through collections of manuscripts and rare texts, I saw firsthand how technology enables us to extend and reshape the archive. Unlike the traditional approach‚Äîwhere a scholar would painstakingly sift through fading pages for months‚Äîdigitization offered a new dimension. Suddenly, these centuries-old materials were not just objects to be physically handled with white gloves; they were also data to be analyzed at scale. SCETI‚Äôs methods highlighted how digital tools can reinvigorate the humanities, allowing scholars to foster connections between texts and contexts that would otherwise remain buried. 
This visit allowed me to want to further look into data and literature, and there I was able to hear about Franco Moretti, and his concept of ‚Äúdistant reading,‚Äù which encourages scholars to understand literary history by examining large bodies of text algorithmically rather than focusing on a select, canonical few, resonated with what I saw at SCETI. Moretti‚Äôs approach reminds us that digital humanities does not simply replicate older methods on faster machines; it reorients our perspective. These ideas resonated more forcefully after watching archivists scan and catalog manuscripts at SCETI, technology was not an useless tool, it was a tool that allowed for deeper, more meaningful humanistic connection.

The idea that digital humanities can be a bridge between seemingly disparate worlds became even clearer during the workshop I attended through the Penn Libraries called ‚ÄúComputational Thinking and Board Games.‚Äù This workshop, unexpectedly, felt like a small revelation. Instead of treating computational thinking as merely a technical skill for programmers, the speaker framed it as a fundamental aspect of how we as humans solve problems.The workshop underscored that digital humanities is not about turning everything into code and data. It is about revealing the complexity of human expression; it can be a poem, a historical archive, or a board game, and using digital tools to make sense of that complexity.

As I reflected on the class, I realized that much of the semester‚Äôs work was about challenging boundaries. While at the start I viewed digital humanities as a tool I do not see myself ever using, a sort of odd hybrid that didn‚Äôt quite belong, I came to understand that it sits at the intersection of disciplines to encourage a rethinking of what constitutes as ‚Äúthe humanities.‚Äù The visits, workshops, and readings showed that the division between humanities and STEM is not a fixed line. Instead, it is more like an area where interdisciplinary work thrives. The act of digitizing a manuscript or applying a text-mining algorithm to a piece is not a technical exercise. It is an act with interpretive choices, possibly even ethical considerations, and historical contexts. Each time we select what to digitize or choose an algorithm for our analysis, we are making a humanistic choice, these choices that can shape the way future scholars can intercept and/or interact with these pieces.

By the end of the semester, as I revisited these projects, I saw how they had the potential to illuminate patterns in historical data or reveal connections between authors and texts that were not visible in a close reading alone. With the benefit of hindsight, I recognize that I could have pushed these projects further, being more thoughtful in the way I presented my information. For example, in our multimedia essay, I had a love story, but I chose to make a close reading of the poem. A possible format of a love letter could have humanized the work of the prisoner even better. The role of digital humanities is to help us decode and re-encode these stories, ensuring that the humanistic core remains always, guiding the choices we make and the questions we ask.

### Final Thoughts üåü  

In the end, I no longer see digital humanities as a **fringe element** . Instead, I understand it as a **dynamic**, evolving field where the humanities continually reinvent themselves through technology, and where technology gains depth and meaning through the humanities. It is an **ongoing dialogue** üîÑ: a conversation that invites new participants, new materials, and new methods into the fold.  

And like **abstract art** üé®, what once seemed obscure can, with the right perspective, reveal profound truths.
